    There are somewhere around 130 million* books globally. With up to a million being published annually in the U.S. alone, this creates a complex question of choice as to what books to read.

BookLook answers this question! With over a quarter million books in our database, BookLook is a repository and recommendation engine. We are free to use, and designed with the user in mind.
Our goal is to engage the transformative power of shared experience through design. The trending page is composed of New York Timesâ€™ bestsellers and is updated weekly.
You can personalize your experience by reviewing books, and our efficient algorithms will provide an optimized recommendation for your next read** (functionality coming soon!)
